# Doomed to Repeat
Doomed to Repeat is a LÃ–VE-powered 2d top-down space physics game concept. In its current iteration it is a crude WIP with no objective and minimal gameplay mechanics.

# What's in the box?
Doomed to Repeat currently features procedurally generated moving solar systems (one per session at the moment), gravity wells, Newtonian(ish?) physics, a ship in which to travel, minimal combat prototyping, enemy ships with random waypoints and objectives, capturable planets and a rudimentary production system on captured planets. There is no "game" yet, i.e., you cannot win (although you can be destroyed.)

# What's next?
Doomed to Repeat is intended to be a ship management game. Although originally designed as a fast-paced twin-stick space shooter, future versions will feature increasingly slow gameplay with a focus on subsystem management. In as many ways as possible I hope for this game to feel like a 90s sub simulator, but in space. I also plan to implement a system whereby the user can manage subsytems through a terminal interface with pseudocode.
